As of right now this repo consists of 

1: Things written by me

a. experimental.html: a rudimentary game that was the first thing I wrote while getting acquainted with three.js

b. controls.js: Some functions that control the movement of a camera and a target in relation to each other while carrying out certain tasks. These are crucial building blocks to the project I hope to implement.

c. walkaround.html: developed in tandem with controls.js to test the functions in controls.js   

html files can be found on the web at www.darynr.com/experimental.html and www.darynr.com/walkaround.html

2: Things written by others

a. three.min.js: a minified version of the three.js library written by mrdoob

b. keyboardState.js: a library for handling keyboard input written by Lee Stemkoski

I have included these files in the repository for completeness i.e. so the repo is self-contained.
